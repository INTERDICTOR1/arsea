Perfect! Let me explain how a system daemon approach would work for Arsea:

## How the Daemon Approach Works

### **The Core Concept:**
Instead of trying to intercept web requests in your app, you manipulate the **DNS resolution process** that ALL applications use to find websites.

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

**1. DNS Resolution Basics**
```
User types "badsite.com" → Computer asks "What's the IP for badsite.com?" 
→ DNS responds "192.168.1.1" → Browser connects to that IP
```

**2. Your Daemon Intercepts This**
```
User types "badsite.com" → Your daemon checks blocklist 
→ If blocked: redirects to 127.0.0.1 (localhost/nowhere)
→ If allowed: normal DNS resolution continues
```

### **Technical Implementation:**

**Method 1: Hosts File Manipulation**
```
# Your daemon writes to system hosts file:
127.0.0.1 pornsite.com
127.0.0.1 anotherbadsite.com
```
- Every app that tries to reach these domains gets redirected to localhost
- Works for browsers, apps, games - everything

**Method 2: Local DNS Server**
```
Your daemon runs a DNS server on localhost:53
System DNS settings point to 127.0.0.1
Your DNS server filters requests before forwarding to real DNS
```

### **Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Background    │    │   System Tray   │    │     Electron    │
│    Daemon       │◄──►│      Icon       │◄──►│       UI        │
│  (Node.js)      │    │   (Controls)    │    │  (Stats/Config) │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  System Hosts   │
│      File       │
│   /etc/hosts    │
└─────────────────┘
```

### **Components:**

1. **Background Service** - Continuously running Node.js process
2. **System Tray Icon** - Quick enable/disable, shows status
3. **Electron UI** - Configuration, stats, blocklist management
4. **Hosts File Manager** - Safely modifies system DNS

### **User Experience:**
1. Install Arsea → Daemon starts automatically with system
2. System tray shows protection is active
3. All browsers now automatically blocked from adult content
4. Click tray icon to temporarily disable or open full UI
5. No need to remember to open an app or use special browser

**Would this approach achieve your goal?** It would block access across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile browsers, apps - everything that uses DNS resolution.
