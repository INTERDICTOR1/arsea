Arsea System-Wide Content Blocker - Development Plan
🎯 Project Objectives
Primary Goal: Transform Arsea from Electron-only blocking to system-wide DNS-level content filtering across all browsers and applications.
Success Criteria:

✅ Block adult content in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
✅ Background service runs automatically on system startup
✅ Simple system tray controls for enable/disable
✅ Maintain existing blocklist management (184K+ domains)
✅ Safe hosts file manipulation without breaking system
