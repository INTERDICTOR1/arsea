# Arsea Content Blocker (Alpha Test Version)

Thank you for helping test Arsea! This is an early version, so your feedback is critical.

Arsea is a system-wide, DNS-based content blocker. It's designed to block ads, trackers, and other unwanted domains across **all** applications on your computer, not just in your web browser.

## üì• Installation

1.  Download the `Arsea-Content-Blocker-Setup-0.1.0.exe` file.
2.  Run the installer.
3.  **Important:** On Windows, the installer will ask for Administrator permissions. This is **required** because Arsea needs to modify system-level network settings to filter DNS requests.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

*   After installation, Arsea will start automatically and you'll find a new icon in your system tray (bottom-right of your screen).
*   **Right-click** the tray icon to open the menu.
*   You can **Enable** or **Disable** the blocking service from this menu.

## üêõ How to Report Bugs & Give Feedback

This is the most important part! Please report everything, even small things.

**The best way to report a bug is to create an "Issue" on GitHub.**

**[Click here to go to the Issues Page](https://github.com/INTERDICTOR1/arsea/issues)**

When you create a new issue, please be as detailed as possible:
*   What were you doing when the problem happened?
*   What did you expect to happen?
*   What actually happened? (Include screenshots if you can!)
*   Did your internet stop working? Did a site that should be blocked still get through? Did the app crash?

This method helps me track all feedback in one place. Thank you!
